We propose a new method for controlling linear dynamical systems under adversarial distur-
bances and cost functions. Our algorithm achieves a running time that scales polylogarithmically
with the inverse of the stability margin, improving upon prior methods with polynomial depen-
dence maintaining the same regret guarantees. The technique, which may be of independent
interest, is based on a novel convex relaxation that approximates linear control policies using
spectral filters constructed from the eigenvectors of a specific Hankel matrix.
